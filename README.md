# `@recaptime-dev/squad-notes` - A digital garden for RecapTime.dev and community

This is what we call as assorted notes that we collaboratively edit as a extension of and incubator for [our Squad Wiki and Handbook](https://wiki.recaptime.dev). You can also access them via [Agora](https://anagora.org) at `@recaptimedev-crew-notes` namespace soon and we use [[Obsidian]] alongside [[VS Code]] to edit them out.

This wiki project by Recap Time Squad is hosted on [[Community Lorebooks]], our free (sub)domain service and project for your documentation and digital gardens.
## Contributions are welcome

Although direct push access into the main branch is limited to `@recaptime-dev/squad` members, we accept community contributions like our wiki such as:

* syndicating your written essays elsewhere into our digital garden for prosperity (especially if you want to bring it outside Slack and Discord and make it discoverable (you can request to take it down anytime, although nuking via git history edits will be chaos))
* adding your own Community/Team Bio (for synchorization with our website repo)

An `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will be in the works in the future, so please keep a eye on this repository for updates.
