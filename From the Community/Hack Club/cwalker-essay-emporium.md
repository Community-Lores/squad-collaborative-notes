## What is Hack Club?

_[Originally published](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07FQBQEV8F/p1723138863161649) on August 8, 2024 at 05:41 UTC Time._

In the last 8 weeks, as ~8k new people have joined our Slack Channel, we've put a lot of effort into explaining what Arcade is (and in some ways,
we still haven't done a great job there). However, we've put almost no effort into explaining what _Hack Club_ is. Understandably,
a lot of new people have assumed that Hack Club _is_ Arcade. Some have even asked us if the Slack will be shut down at the end of the summer! In fact,
Hack Club was already 8 years old when Arcade started.

So what is it? It's actually not easy to define Hack Club. It's a
lot of different things, with many separate projects running under the umbrella of one foundation. Some of the components that make up Hack Club are:

- A global network of after-school clubs
- A large online community, here on Slack
- A collection of "You Ship, We Ship" programs ([Blot](https://blot.hackclub.com/), [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/), [OnBoard](https://hackclub.com/onboard/), etc)
- An irregular series of temporary virtual programs (Arcade, Summer of Making, Winter Hardware Wonderland, etc)
- A handful of HQ-run events every year
- Several hundred community-run events every year
- A large [fiscal sponsorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship#:~:text=Fiscal%20sponsorship%20refers%20to%20the,and%20an%20established%20non%2Dprofit.) program (see <https://hackclub.com/hcb>)
- An internship and gap-year program for the teenagers who run the show here
- A physical headquarters slowly taking over the town of Shelburne, Vermont ([Google Maps]

And here are here are a few descriptions we've used to summarize all that over the years:

- Hack Club is a community of teenagers who build things with technology
- Hack Club is building projects with your friends
- Hack Club is a nice place where nice people do nice things for each other
- Hack Club is a long-term bet that the best technical education program for teenagers can be built by other teenagers
- Hack Club is the community that its founders wished they had in high school

To take it one step further, we could try to summarize all those summaries like this:
**Hack Club is [hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) for teenagers, institutionalized.**

So why do we want to do that? Why are we building an institution to support hacker culture? Because hacker culture is built on the values of the [hacker ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic#The_hacker_ethics), and we think those values are important. I considered trying to explain why, but… if you're here, chances are you don't need me to. Despite the importance of hacker ethic, there are _very few institutions dedicated to propagating it_, and even fewer for teenagers specifically. We want to fill that gap.

I could end this essay here, but I'd like to cover one final definition of Hack Club, grander and more ambitious than all the others: **Hack Club is the hacker-oriented arm of the public education system.**

To unpack that, let's zoom way out and consider that the 20th century witnessed a remarkable change in the problems faced by humanity: for most of history, our greatest challenges have been imposed by nature. Disease. Hunger. Shelter. Today, however, a remarkable share of our greatest challenges are problems we created for ourselves. Climate change. Pollution. Obesity. Nuclear proliferation. Ecosystem collapse.

The 20th century was defined by the industrial revolution, when we just needed people to build new complex systems from the primitive blocks of nature. Today we need something more: we need people who can manipulate, adapt, extend, and sometimes even dismantle the complex systems we've already built. We need people working within established systems in ways that go beyond their original design and architecture, because in their present configuration _those systems are literally killing us_. Across all levels of government, technology, agriculture, education, we need people with a different skillset and mindset than what you learn in a school system designed for the industrial revolution. In a word, we need hackers… and schools today are simply not set up to produce hackers. For all the ways the world has changed in the last century, schools have barely changed at all.

Hack Club is a way of hacking the education system to produce more hackers. That's our mission… and we need your help. Look around our website, slack channel, or any event with our name on it. Wherever your gaze may fall, odds are you are looking at something that was partly or wholly created by a high-schooler. Hack Club was _founded_ by a sixteen-year-old who dropped out of high school because he knew that his school couldn't offer the skills or community that he needed. We hope you will stick around after Arcade is over, because if we're gonna build the hacker-oriented arm of the public education system, we're gonna need a lot of hackers.

## The Hacker Mindset

_Originally published on August 27, 2024 at 08:19_

In my last essay we learned what Hack Club is:  

- Hacker Culture for teenagers, institutionalized
- The hacker-oriented arm of the public education system
- A way of hacking the education system to produce more hackers

Now let’s talk about how we actualize those definitions. Hack Club operates on the basis of _experimentation_ and _iteration_. **There is no grand strategy in Hack Club;** that’s not how hackers operate. A key distinction between _hacking_ and _engineering_ is that engineers have faith in their ability to design highly complex systems from fundamental principles. That confidence is necessary because a bridge has to work the first time, and well-founded because they almost always do! Eons of experimentation and iteration have allowed us to painstakingly extract very accurate abstractions of how bridges stand—and how they fall. Perhaps the earliest bridges were built with something closer to a hacker mindset… but at some point the discipline passed through a big fuzzy gray area into the realm of engineering, where enormous complexity can be safely navigated with the aid of rigorous fundamental principles.

There are no rigorous fundamental principles for what Hack Club does. It's something new, and we are feeling around in the dark. We do have some fundamental principles for _parts_ of what we do, most notably the parts that live wholly on computers. Hack Club employs many people who can (and do) build highly-scalable databases and blazingly-fast websites on the first try… but Hack Club is not in the business of databases and websites. Hackers may engage in engineering, but it's not what makes us _hackers_. At Hack Club, the hacker mindset becomes most important and apparent when our systems make contact with humans. This is where the darkness envelops us, and we cannot trust our ability to design complex things from fundamental principles.

So, how do we navigate unknown terrain in the dark? How do we find the highest peaks, and avoid the lowest valleys, when we don't have a reliable map?Experimentation and iteration are the hacker's tools for exploring new territory. To solve a problem, first we formulate an idea and try it out _as quickly as possible_ (the "Minimum Viable Product", or MVP). Speed matters much more than theoretical correctness here, because we assume at this point that our theories are no good, and we expect to have to build a bunch of experiments! The purpose of an experiment is not to be right, it's to gather data; even when the result is negative, each real-world test reveals a tiny sample of truth about the overall landscape beneath our feet. Most things built in Hack Club _do not work out._ But eventually, inevitably, our parade of experiments will turn up something that works—even if only a little—and we can begin to iterate on our quest for the summit.If experimentation is the process of looking for hills, iteration is the process of climbing them. Building and testing a single experiment tells you how well that one thing works—it gives you the height of the terrain—but a step in any direction from there tells you something more: the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient). Every small tweak to an existing product is a step that tells you which direction leads upward. Good, quick iteration tends to rapidly improve a product… but then improvement slows down as you reach the top of the hill, which may not be very high. Most hills are not mountains, and you cannot iterate your way to Everest. It's time for another round of experiments—but this time, you know where the foothills begin.

[![smaller, faster-loading version of an animation that both Chris Walker and Kartikey Chauhan spent forever on](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0266FRGM-F07K5BZNMQR/experimentation_iteration_algorithms_smaller.gif?pub_secret=2325971b87)](https://replit.com/@skartikey314/monte-carlo-gradient-ascent?from=notifications#script.js)

This process repeats. Every time you approach the top of a hill, you jump around looking for a bigger one to climb next. Eventually, you'll find yourself on top of a mountain. Practically every good thing that has ever been built in Hack Club began as a humble, simple experiment. And among all the big, complicated, mountainous projects you see being built here—both from staff and within the community—there are _hundreds_ of tiny, simple, nimble experiments blinking in and out of existence every day. You'll never see most of them, because most of them never go very far; but each of them is as critical to this process as the steps we take atop mountains like [HCB](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/) or [Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade/). Which leads us to a beautiful truth: you, dear hacker, are as much a part of this revolution as I am. You don't need to be an adult, spend years in our slack, or be some kind of wizard programmer. If you publicly try things, take small steps, and stay determined, you're doing your part. Never forget: **complicated things that work are almost always evolved from simple things that work.**

On March 27th 2024, a 16 year old in Texas named Manitej created a channel in our Slack called [`#hack-hour`][hackhour-channel] [^1] as a place for other teenagers to use his personal [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) bot. **Anyone can build a pomodoro timer.** The original bot didn't even have a codebase, it was just a Slack workflow. But this random little experiment worked well enough for a few other hackers to use it, so Manitej started iterating, and it grew. He created a proper Slackbot, gave it personality, and marketed it around the channel. Eventually, Max from HQ decided to run an experiment with him where they gave out rewards for your hours. More iterations. Another experiment. Less than three months after the channel was created, they renamed it to [`#arcade`][hackhour-channel] and launched what became the largest online event Hack Club has ever run, logging over 120,000 hours and distributing well over $100k worth of resources to teenage hackers all over the world.**This is how Hack Club works.** Let's recall one other definition of Hack Club from the previous essay:  

> Hack Club is a long-term bet that the best technical education program for teenagers can be built by other teenagers

That doesn't mean every bit of work in Hack Club is done by teenagers. It means that a critical mass of teenagers with a hacker mindset can be the engine of a revolution in education. **We literally cannot do this without you.** Neither me nor anyone else on our staff would have ever tried building a pomodoro clock, but that ultimately worked better than just about anything we've ever done. At the same time, Arcade had _many_ problems… we are nowhere near the summit! Many, many cycles of experimentation and iteration lie ahead of us. I hope you'll be a part of them.

[^1]: **Editor note from Andrei Jiroh**: While the original Slack version points to a [soft redirect in archived state](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C07BQN53V5X) during the the rename from Hack Hour to Arcade and back after the event (currently `#not-hack-hour` as of time of editing), I adjusted the channel name to reflect the history.
