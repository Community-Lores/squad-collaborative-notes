# ~ajhalili2006

**Andrei Jiroh Halili** is the founder and lead open-source developer/maintainer and a SABDFL[^1] at Recap Time Squad.

## The Basics

- **Pronouns**: he/they
- **Birthdate**: January 23, 2006
- **Place**: Marilao, Bulacan, Philippines
- **Role at RecapTime.dev**: Open-source Developer, Squad Lead[^1] / SABDFL

## From their own words
I am the lead open-source developer/maintainer here at Recap Time Squad, which I usually referred to as a squad lead[^1] since 2018 under numerous names before I settled with the current name during the pandemic. I am mostly the JavaScript/TypeScript guy here in Node.js and Deno, hence been working on the backend and CLI apps (because I love back(end) pain).
I'm disabled and/or neurodivergent[^2], specifically as a early-diagnosed autist (often high-masking in real life), so please apologize for limited availability (due to autistic burnout and mental health reasons) and sometimes ~~abandoning projects[^3]~~ taking a break to prioritize my well-being and focus on school.

## Disclosures
Other than being disabled/neurodivergent myself, I have some to disclose:
- I am a crypto native, although I only hold small amounts of crypto (both in custodian and non-custodian wallets) and mostly spent on catching up with the news.
- I am a Hack Clubber since Arcade 2024, although not affiliated with the HQ (If you're ~zrl or someone else at Hack Club HQ and you have any remote job positions open because I understand that sponsoring a US work visas for newly-hired people, especially interns, could spell nightmares on the budget, I am happy to apply. Just slide into my LinkedIn/Slack DMs if you do. :simile:). It happened that I chose Hack Club as our ~~potential~~ future fiscal host[^4]
## Socials

I am mostly found active over at [the fediverse via the `tilde.zone` homeserver](https://tilde.zone/@ajhalili2006)
([also on `verified.TLD`](https://verified.social/@ajhalili2006), with varying degrees of activity at [Threads](https://threads.net/@ajhalili2006), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/)

You can find all the links at <https://links.andreijiroh.dev>, as well as all the projects on [my own Glitch-in-Bio](https://portfolio.andreijiroh/dev).

[^1]: For the technically inclined, I am considered as a [SABDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth) or a project leader depending on the Linux distribution you are using (either Ubuntu or Arch if you will). I may rename that from "squad lead" once Recap Time Squad is no longer a one-man operation.
[^2]: Personally, I do not use the term "superpower" to describe my autism diagnosis and being disabled and neurodivergent are not mutually exclusive.
[^3]: I'll say "abandoning projects as if they're children", but that's sound like Michael Moy's "how do I abandon the children" Twitch chat message, which may cause someone to call the police.
[^4]: As of time of writing (2024-10-19), timezone differences has caused headaches between myself and our HCB contact but still working on that.
