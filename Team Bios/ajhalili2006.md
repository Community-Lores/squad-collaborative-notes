## The Basics

## Bio

I am the lead open-source developer/maintainer here at Recap Time Squad, which I usually referred to as a squad lead[^1] since 2018. I am mostly the JavaScript guy here in Node.js and Deno, hence been working on the backend and CLI apps.

I'm disabled and/or neurodivergent[^2], specifically as a early-diagnosed autist, so please apologize for limited availability (due to autistic burnout and mental health reasons) and sometimes ~~abandoning projects[^3]~~ taking a break to prioritize my well-being and focus on school.

## Socials

I am mostly found active over at [the fediverse via the `tilde.zone` homeserver](https://tilde.zone/@ajhalili2006),
with varying degrees of activity at [Threads](https://threads.net/@ajhalili2006).

[^1]: For the technically inclined, I am considered as a [SABDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth) or a project leader depending on the Linux distribution you are using. I may rename that from "squad lead" once Recap Time Squad is no longer a one-man operation.
[^2]: Personally, I do not use the term "superpower" to describe my autism diagnosis and being disabled and neurodivergent are not mutually exclusive.
[^3]: I'll say "abandoing projects as if they're children", but that's sound like Michael Moy's "how do I abandon the children" Twitch chat message, which may cause someone to call the police.
