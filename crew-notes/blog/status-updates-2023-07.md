> **WARNING: PUBLIC DRAFT!** Please see [the legal disclaimer at the repo's README](/README.md#legal-disclaimer) for details about upcoming updates.

Inspired by [Project Segfault](https://blog.projectsegfau.lt/tag/state-of-project-segfault/), some of the sourcehut maintainers, and [even our current BDFL and lead maintainer themselves](https://ajhalili2006.substack.com/archive?sort=search&search=status%20update), we'll start writing these monthly (or quarterly if school go backs in September for ~ajhalili2006) status updates

## The Squad Wiki, now in Markdown
