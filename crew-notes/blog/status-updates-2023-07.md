> **WARNING: PUBLIC DRAFT!**

Inspired by [Project Segfault](https://blog.projectsegfau.lt/tag/state-of-project-segfault/), some of the sourcehut maintainers, and [even our current BDFL and lead maintainer themselves](https://ajhalili2006.substack.com/archive?sort=search&search=status%20update), we'll start writing these monthly (or quarterly if school go backs in September for ~ajhalili2006) status updates
