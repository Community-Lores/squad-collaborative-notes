> **WARNING: PUBLIC DRAFT!** Please see [the legal disclaimer at the repo's README](/README.md#legal-disclaimer) for details about upcoming updates.

Inspired by [Project Segfault](https://blog.projectsegfau.lt/tag/state-of-project-segfault/), [some](https://drewdevault.com/) [sourcehut](https://bitfehler.srht.site/) [maintainers](https://emersion.fr/), and [even our current BDFL and lead maintainer themselves](https://ajhalili2006.substack.com/archive?sort=search&search=status%20update), we'll start writing these monthly (or quarterly if school go back in September for ~ajhalili2006) status updates.

To get things started, we'll talk about our organizational wiki, state of project maintenance and then some.

## The Squad Wiki, now in Markdown

You might be heard about [possible closure of Miraheze](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Board/Policies/20230615-Statement) after [an emergency board meeting](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Board/Policies/20230607-Minutes), mostly due to volunteer burnout ([see diff](https://meta.miraheze.org/w/index.php?diff=339060&diffmode=visual)). There's news that the [community volunteers has a plan to save the project](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Miraheze_is_Not_Shutting_Down), although we always cross our fingers whenever the future holds.
